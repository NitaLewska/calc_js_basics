# calc_basics
This is the project I made to practice JavaScript basics.

I decided to use a real calculator photo as a base to build my project on, and it was a very interesting challenge to do.
Transparent buttons are placed using a grid layout and they change their colour being hovered - that's how I've tried to simulate pressing real buttons.

Clicking the "0ff" button disables all buttons except "C/CE" button, which usually works as an "On" button on most calculators.
